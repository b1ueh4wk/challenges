# Welcome to your personal storage of daily challenges. 

You can structure this HOWEVER you want. We will be doing this daily so please keep that in mind as this can get messy very fast. Personally I recommend a YEAR > MONTH > DAY approach.

Go to this repositories' "Issues", assign yourself to it, create your own branch, and solve the daily challenges here in your own space, push it up, create a pull request, resolve issues, and eventually get your submission merged to main.
